            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, better known as APJ Abdul Kalam, was an illustrious scientist
            turned statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam spent more than
            forty years as a science
            administrator and scientist mainly at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Defence Research
            and the
            Development Organization (DRDO). He was closely associated with the military missile development efforts
            and
            civilian space programme of India. For his work on launch vehicle technology and development of
            ballistic missile, he
            was given the pseudonym of ‘The Missile Man of India.’ In 1998, he played a prominent role in Pokhran-II
            Nuclear
            Tests.<br><br>

            In 2002, he was elected the 11th President of the country and became widely known as the ‘People’s
            President.’ After serving his presidential term he pursued what he loved most – teaching, writing and
            reading. For his
            achievements and contributions as a scientist, he was honoured with the ‘Bharat Ratan Award,’ India’s
            highest civilian
            honour.
            <br><br>
            He left for the heavenly abode on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of
            Management (IIM) Shillong. He was laid to rest with full state-honours and his funeral was attended by
            thousands of
            people including national-level dignitaries.
            APJ Abdul Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu,
            on October
            15, 1931. His mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife and his father, Jainulabdeen, was an imam of a local mosque
            and a boat
            owner. He was the youngest in the family with four elder brothers and a sister.
            <br><br>
            Though, the family was not financially affluent yet all the children were raised in an atmosphere that was
            full of love
            and compassion. In order to add to the family’s income, Kalam had to sell newspapers during his early years.
            <br><br>
            He was an average student during his school, but possessed a strong desire to learn and was very hard
            working. He loved
            mathematics and spent hours studying the subject. He pursued his education from ‘Schwartz Higher Secondary
            School,’ and
            then graduated from ‘Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli,’ in 1954. He wanted to become a fighter pilot
            but his
            dream could not be fulfilled as here were only eight positions available in the IAF and he secured the ninth
            place.
            <br><br>

            In 2002, Kalam was chosen the Presidential nominee by the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), and he
            was elected
            the President. He became the 11th President of India on July 25, 2002 and served the position till July 25,
            2007.
            <br><br>
            He also became the third President of India to have received ‘Bharat Ratna’ before assuming the office of
            the President.
            <br><br>
            Due to his style of working and interaction with common people, especially the youth, he was affectionately
            called ‘The
            People’s President.’ According to Dr. Kalam, the most arduous decision he had taken during his tenure was
            that of
            signing the ‘Office of Profit Bill.’
            <br><br>
            During his tenure as President, he faced criticism for his inaction in deciding the fate of mercy petitions
            that were
            submitted to him. Out of the 21 mercy petitions, he acted only on one mercy plea. In 2005, he recommended
            for
            President’s rule in Bihar, which also became a controversial decision.
